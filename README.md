## For Those Tough Days...
Hey there! If you're feeling down, remember:

- Depression is just your brain being a drama queen. Tell it to chill! 🧊
- You're not alone - even your phone's battery feels low sometimes 🔋
- Think of yourself as a potato. Potatoes can become fries, chips, or mashed potatoes. You too have endless possibilities! 🥔
- Your bed might be your best friend right now, but remember - even beds need to be made sometimes 🛏️
- You're like a phone updating its software - sometimes you need time to process things 📱
- Remember: Every cloud has a silver lining... and probably decent WiFi 📶

## Words of Encouragement
- "Plot twist: You're actually awesome!" 
- "Your thoughts matter, even if you're not ready to share them"
- "You're doing better than you think, and yes, getting out of bed counts as an achievement"
- "If life gives you lemons, throw them back and demand chocolate! 🍫"

Built with:
- SwiftUI
- Core Data for local storage

## Remember
It's okay to not be okay. It's okay to need space. It's okay to process things at your own pace. This is your safe space to be yourself, no pressure, no judgments. 🌟
